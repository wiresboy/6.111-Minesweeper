2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-11#1 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance minesweeper/td/image_addr is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.021 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/zero_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[11] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.039 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/flag_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[12] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.045 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/three_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[14] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.070 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/flag_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[13] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.086 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/flag_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[11] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0).

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.128 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/zero_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[12] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0).
