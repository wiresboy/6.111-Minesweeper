SYNTH-11#1 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance minesweeper/td/image_addr is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.004 ns between xvga1/vcount_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and minesweeper/td/five_rom/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/ADDRARDADDR[14] (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0).
