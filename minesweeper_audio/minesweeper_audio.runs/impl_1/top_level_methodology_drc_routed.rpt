2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning

No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_25mhz_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at td/hcount_temp_reg[0][7]_i_1 of size 6x6, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
